As of now, the following project code will not be uploaded due to confidentiality issues.

CURRENT- GWS Relational Database and Scoring Algorithm Design: Development of RDB using constellation schema for managing genetic annotations using Python and SQL. Generalization for necessary data to be implemented in research of transposable elements interaction scoring implements pyrange. Assemble simulated training set and design semi-supervised learning model to automate parameter evaluations assuming linear regression learning algorithms. Results will be used to study diseases associated w/ AS events due to TE interaction using cell-type RNA-seq data.

CURRENT- Visual Recognition and Text Generation: Design FCNN to recognize human features captured by live camera input, apply semantic segmentation and use results to generate text description of features using Tensorflow. Training data generated and each portion tested in NVIDIA Jetson using Docker container w/ PyTorch. Output implemented using JavaScript.
